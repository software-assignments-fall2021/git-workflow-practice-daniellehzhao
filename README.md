The [article] (https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon) I will be talking about is related to the idea of the metaverse. According to Facebook, <em>“The ‘metaverse’ is a set of virtual spaces where you can create and explore with other people who aren’t in the same physical space as you.”<em> It's an interesting concept as there's no one single aspect or product that can create the metaverse; rather, it is constantly expanding and being connected to new experiences as we develop tools for the digital world. I was working on a project related to NFTs over the summer which really made me think about what I think of as tangible or real and the impact of digital space. There were millions of dollars being exchanged for these digital tokens. There are a lot of ways that the metaverse will exist: it stands to alter how we allocate and monetize modern resources, will bleed into the physical world, will have a range of contributors, and hopefully will give everyone a presence and sense of agency.
